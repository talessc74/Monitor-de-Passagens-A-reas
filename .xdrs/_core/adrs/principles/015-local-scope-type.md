# _core-adr-policy-015: _local scope type

## Context and Problem Statement

Every XDRS workspace may need project-specific overrides or local decisions that are not applicable elsewhere. These decisions must be kept in the workspace and never distributed or shared. A reserved scope type is needed to identify and enforce this boundary.

## Decision Outcome

**Reserve `scope-type: _local` exclusively for the `_local` scope, which holds workspace-local decisions that MUST NOT leave the repository.**

### Details

#### 01-scope-type-name

The scope type defined by this policy is `_local`. A scope MUST declare it by setting `scope-type: _local` in its `index.md` YAML frontmatter.

#### 02-when-to-use

Use `scope-type: _local` only for the built-in `_local` scope. This scope type is reserved and MUST NOT be used for any other scope.

The `_local` scope holds project-specific decisions, local overrides, and workspace-specific content that applies only to the current repository. Examples: local tooling decisions, workspace-specific process overrides, temporary decisions during a transition.

#### 03-exclusive-reservation

The value `scope-type: _local` is reserved exclusively for the single scope named `_local`. Other scopes MUST NOT use this scope type.

#### 04-never-distributed

Content in the `_local` scope MUST NOT be shared with or propagated to any other context. It is workspace-local only and MUST NOT be packaged for distribution.
